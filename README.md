# Massmine-for-the-Masses

Description of the project

Massmine-for-the-Masses is an open-source, proof of concept tool. It extends the functionality of the big data gathering tool Massmine which is a command-line interface.  Massmine-for-the-Masses has a graphical user interface that allows users to see data being collected and view it in real-time, from social media platforms. The data will also be presented in a simple user interface to allow for basic analysis without the user ever having to directly interact with it.
This is an improvement of the existing project(https://github.com/JoshCMoore/Massmine-for-the-Masses) where all the web pages are redesigned to enhance the user experience and offer smooth navigation throughout its design.
